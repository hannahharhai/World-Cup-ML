# World-Cup-ML

Tested whether or not it is possible to accurately predict the FIFA World Cup using the power of machine learning and historical data. My approach was to use a binary classification algorithm to try and classify the losers and the winner of a tournament. 

After training my model and running tests to calculate the accuracy of the model, I found it is in fact possible to predict the World Cup using ML techniques and relevant data. 

For a detailed analysis please view the typed report pdf file along with the jupyter notebook to see the code.
