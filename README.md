# World-Cup-ML

Tested whether or not it is possible to accurately predict the FIFA World Cup using the power of machine learning and historical data. My approach was to use a binary classification algorithm to try and classify the losers and the winner of a tournament. I used metrics from previous World Cup matches including total number of player awards each team has received, number of wins in World Cup competitions, number of goals scored in World Cup competitions, and previous tournament standings for each competition (top 4 teams are ranked) to train my model. 

I completed this project using python programming language with the help of various libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplot, etc. I also collected my data/datasets from the Fjelstul World Cup Database found on Github.

After training my model and running tests to calculate the accuracy of the model, I found it is in fact possible to predict the World Cup using ML techniques and relevant data. 

For a detailed analysis please view the IEEE report pdf file along with the jupyter notebook to see code implementation.
